## Why this project?

During my first pregnancy, I was identified as being at increased risk for gestational diabetes during my very first prenatal appointment. Although I ultimately did not develop gestational diabetes, I underwent additional screening and experienced months of uncertainty while waiting for definitive testing.

That experience sparked a question:

> Could routinely collected information from the first prenatal visit be used to estimate gestational diabetes risk earlier using an explainable machine learning model?

This project explores that question by developing and evaluating interpretable predictive models using maternal demographic, clinical, and medical history data available during early prenatal care. The goal is not to replace clinical diagnosis, but to investigate whether machine learning can support earlier risk assessment and more informed clinical decision-making.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to investigate whether routinely collected clinical information available during the first prenatal visit can be used to predict gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) before routine diagnostic screening.

The project emphasizes:

- Explainable machine learning
- Reproducible data science workflows
- Clinically meaningful model evaluation
- Transparent documentation of analytical decisions

## Research Question

## Current Progress

The project has completed the data understanding and exploratory data analysis phases.

Completed work includes:

- Dataset audit
- Missing data investigation
- Data quality assessment
- Documentation of preprocessing decisions
- Creation of a cleaned dataset for downstream analysis
- Exploratory analysis of continuous and binary clinical variables
- Investigation of relationships with gestational diabetes
- Correlation and missingness analysis

The next phase focuses on feature engineering and preparation of a modeling-ready dataset for machine learning.

## Planned Modeling Approach

To evaluate whether gestational diabetes can be predicted using information available during the first prenatal visit, several machine learning models will be developed and compared.

The planned modeling pipeline includes:

- Logistic Regression (interpretable baseline)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

Models will be evaluated using clinically meaningful performance metrics, including:

- ROC-AUC
- Recall (Sensitivity)
- Precision
- F1-score
- Calibration (Brier Score and calibration curves)

Model explainability techniques, including SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), will be used to interpret predictions and identify the most influential clinical features.

Rather than selecting the model with the highest predictive performance alone, this project emphasizes the trade-offs between predictive performance, interpretability, calibration, and potential clinical usefulness.
